        <p>Axios is a library in JavaScript that performs HTTP requests either from the server or from XMLHttpRequests from the browser. This library operates on the promise principle, meaning we handle the data we want to obtain. Through this paragraph, we can mention some of its features, in addition to other advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> One of the important features of Axios is its isomorphic nature, meaning it can run in the browser as well as on the server-side in Node.js applications with the same codebase.</li>
            <li> It can be used in plain JavaScript as well as in advanced JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Angular.</li>
            <li> It supports all modern browsers.</li>
            <li>Request and response interception, simplified error handling.</li>
            <li> Support for upload progress, compatibility with older browsers.</li>
            <li>Automatic conversion of JSON data.</li>
            <li> Importantly, Axios allows us to intercept responses and errors using the feature of interceptors. In this case, we use the response interceptor tool to capture errors and log them. If a request is canceled, we avoid displaying an error notification.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most common way for front-end programs to communicate with servers is through the HTTP protocol. You may be familiar with the Fetch API and the XMLHttpRequest interface, which allow you to fetch resources and make HTTP requests. However, these features are what make us lean towards using Axios, the most important of which is detecting errors before they occur, instead of using conditional statements and not being aware of all possible errors. Here is data retrieved via Axios, and next, we will learn about the code we used.</p>
